# Stack Templates

Stack templates for creating new Haskell projects beyond those included in [the official repo](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack-templates).

Run `stack new <PROJECT NAME> ./stack-templates/relude.hsfiles` (for example) to create a new project with one of these templates.

## relude

Minimal project template with a custom prelude ([Relude](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/relude)), strict treatment of GHC warnings, and `tasty`/`tasty-hunit`/`hedgehog` for testing.
